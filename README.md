## Thing I wanna add ro do to LightningFastRom:
* Add more useful feature like Mac/iOS Airdrop support,  Contact & Calendar syncing for Yahoo email user plus Bluetooth tethering Quick Settings Tile.
* Add a DJ Mode for large tablet with a 10.1 or larger screen so other who DJ can be use as a DJ midi over USB, WiFi or Bluetooth controller.
* Choose better local media player with video playback support like older version of iOS.
* Add [HackerKeyboard](https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard) by @klausw as source.
* Add [OpenCamera]([https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/files/)) by @Mark Harman as source & tweak UI to look more premium.

## Note:
All devices Listed on here are built useing https://github.com/LightningFastRom by @DJABHipHop on xda exept for Gtelwifiue(As I'm still not ready since my rom and other devices on not running Oreo or Pi yet.) & Grouper(As I dont own one).
LightningFastRom is based on LineageOS minus the crap & none of the ugly / unnessary feature like audio visualizer, music playback control with volume keys, etc.. P.S if anyones want to join and help add new & useful feature, improve & optimize the rom for legacy devices feel free to ask on XDA.
